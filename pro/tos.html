<li>Automatic renewal rules:
(1) Automatic renewal is a service that has been introduced to address the need of a user for automatic renewal and payment at the time they sign up for Pro services, against any failure to renew in time due to negligence or other reasons. Users can choose whether to activate automatic renewal. If they do, they will be deemed to have agreed to authorize Livestatus to issue debit instructions following the debit rules of the third-party payment channel when the subscription is soon to expire, for fees of the next term to be debited from the account without verifying member account password, payment password, SMS verification code and other information.
(2) The User&#39;s authorization to LiveStatus of direct debit is valid for an infinite term, unless deactivated by the User.
(3) LiveStatus will perform direct debit one day before the expiration of Pro member services. If your third-party account balance is insufficient to cover the fees for the next term of Pro member services, LiveStatus will perform a second direct debit at any time on the same day of the first failed direct debit attempt. If your third-party account balance is still insufficient to cover the fees for the next term of Pro services at the time of the second direct debit, LiveStatus will automatically stop providing Pro services upon expiration of the subscription term. You will be responsible for any risk and/or loss of failure to renew due to insufficient available balance in the foregoing.
(4) The date of direct debit for automatic renewal shall fall on the day before the expiration of the subscription term (That means, if the subscription date is 29 March, the date of direct debit for the next term will be 28 April (for monthly subscription), 28 June (for quarterly subscription), and 28 March the following year (for annual subscription). Once upon successful debit, LiveStatus will sign you up for the Pro services corresponding to this billing cycle. However, for Android users, if their renewal starts prior to the 28th day (inclusive), their direct debit date will be the corresponding day of the next term, and if their renewal starts after the 28th day, their direct debit date will be the 28th day of the next term. For example, if the renewal starts on 29 March, the direct debit date of the next term will be 28 April (for monthly subscription), 28 June (for quarterly subscription), and 28 March the following year (for annual subscription).
(5)LiveStatus hereby reminds you that the amount of the Pro service fee you paid for this billing cycle is based on the automatic renewal rate agreed upon with LiveStatus when you signed up for Pro services: however, in cases where LiveStatus is on a campaign or has otherwise agreed with you, your relevant agreement with LiveStatus shall apply. At the same time, if you unsubscribed and signed up for Pro services again, the amount of the Pro service fee that you pay for this billing cycle shall be based on the automatic renewal rate agreed withLiveStatus at your re-signup.</li>
<li>Method for deactivation of automatic renewal:
(1) iOS users: Please open Settings on your phone and tap your profile photo to see your Apple ID settings. Tap Subscriptions and choose to cancel your LiveStatus subscription. Please note that the cancellation should be done at least 24 hours prior to the auto-renewal deduction, or the subscription may remain valid and you may be charged.</li>
